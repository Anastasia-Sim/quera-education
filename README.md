# QuEra Educational Materials

Welcome to QuEra's course on quantum computing and neutral-atom technologies! Following this material you will be brought from 0 to 1 (or ground to Rydberg!) on concepts and programming schemes for doing experiments and simulations with our quantum tech and beyond. Stay tuned for updates, exercises, homework, and future challenges!
